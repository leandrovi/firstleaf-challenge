# React Coding Challenge

## Description

This project contains the basis for our coding challenge.

It doesn't define any UI limitations in any way and only gives you the basic components for SEO/Links/Infinite Scrolling while creating a comfortable development environment to get started.

This repo supports both [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and JavaScript, comes with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) configurations and allows you to write Unit/Integration tests out of the box.

There will be Readme's across the repo to describe the architecture as well as the challenges you will see.

## Challenges

- [Promo](src/components/Countdown/README.md)
- [TheBucket](src/components/TheBucket/README.md)
- [Countries](src/pages/countries/README.md)

Complete at least 2 of the 3 challenges presented in the repo, make sure to assess them and prioritize as you see fit.

My Notes

- Countdown
  - Added tailwind
  - Added shadcn for layout, which has radix behind the hood
  - Extended the custom useProducts hook to have a centralized reducer for products and filters
  - Refactored the product fetching to work with a local cache with a small revalidation logic
  - Used lottie to display a user friendly loading state
- TheBucket
  - Worked on small fixes and improved the performance with memoization
  - The requirements asked to not change the returns at all - so I literally followed that, that's why the UI isn't that good
- Countries
  - Added infinite scrolling with react-window
  - Data fetched during SSG and stored in the data layer
- Analytics
  - Set up segment for analytics
  - It may be used further to track events and send them to a lot of destinations, including google analytics, mixpanel, etc.
  - Added a custom hook useAnalytics to centralize the analytics calls
- General
  - Sentry for error tracking
  - Storybook for component development
